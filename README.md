### Understanding the Problem
- Screen: The screen displays the result based on the button clicked by the user.
- Buttons:
    - Clear button: Clears the screen.
    - Backspace button: Removes the last character on the screen.
    - Operation buttons: Performs the corresponding operation based on the button clicked.
    - Numbers and decimal: Allows input of numbers and decimal points.

### Plan

#### Interface
The design of the interface will be done using Figma and will be handled when finally coding, in HTML and CSS.
#### Input
The input will come from the user by clicking the buttons.
#### Output
The output will be presented on the screen as soon as the user clicks a button.
#### Basic Pseudocode
```
START
ON click buttons
    OUTPUT to screen
END
```

## Technologies
